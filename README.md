# Minishell

A simple shell created in the context of my studies.

It works like a regular shell, you can pipe (`|`) and redirect (`>` and `<`)
commands into one another. You can also use <C-c> and <C-d>.

Autocompletion is not implemented.

## How to use

Run `make` to build the project.

Run `./minishell` to start the shell, and use like you would bash.

`make fclean` will delete the object files.
